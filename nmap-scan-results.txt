# Cybersecurity Internship â€“ Task 1
# Nmap Scan Results
# Date: September 22, 2025
# Scanner: Nmap (Kali Linux)
# Target Subnet: 192.168.231.0/24

------------------------------------------------------------
Scan 1: 192.168.xxx.xxx
Command: nmap -sS -v -O -Pn 192.168.xxx.xxx

Host seems down.

------------------------------------------------------------
Scan 2: 192.168.xxx.xxx
Command: nmap -O 192.168.xxx.xxx

Host seems down. If it is really up, but blocking our ping probes, try -Pn.

------------------------------------------------------------
